For copyright reasons, we cannot distribute the jar files required
for building the project. You will need a jar file called "Kindlet-1.*.jar"
in the /opt/amazon/ebook/lib/ directory of any Kindle 3 or 4.

Sorry. But it's not our fault.

For the Booklet version, in addition to that, you'll also need another jar file:
"kaf.jar".
