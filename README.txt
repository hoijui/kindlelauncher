Currently /hopefully/ supporting the Kindle 3 Keyboard, Kindle 4 Range, Kindle Touch's and P/W (beta test let's call it)

Will eventually support most models.

SUPPORT: READ THIS >>>

YOU WILL NEED TO HAVE AN EXTENSION INSTALLED FOR THIS TO BE USEFUL.

In fact we REQUIRE you have something in /mnt/us/extensions. That is simply a folder called extensions located in the ROOT of the drive WHEN YOU ATTACH VIA USB TO FAT... So that is nice and clear. In fact let's be really clear: The same one where you find the folder called documents "What? that really obvious place right where all the other default folders are?", "Yep, There.". if you don't have one just make one...

BitRot, No Magic, Voodoo (or Unicorns)  (what will work, what won't work)
SOME OF THE OLDER PROGRAMS NO LONGER WORK ON THE NEWER KINDLES (nothing to do with this launcher they just dont work properly anymore) SUCH AS MANY IN THIS OLD LIST: http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Kindle_Touch_Hacking#Extensions_for_the_GUI_Launcher SOME OF THESE DONT WORK 
AS A COURTESY THESE BROKEN APPLICATIONS ARE LISTED BELOW UNDER KNOWN ISSUES IN AN EFFORT TO SAVE YOU GRIEF AND WASTED TIME

ALSO: SOME EXTENSION SUCH AS Kterm ARE DEVICE SPECIFIC.
THIS LAUNCHER WON'T MAGICALLY MAKE CODE THAT IS DEVICE SPECIFIC WORK ON OTHER DEVICES. If it doesn't normally work on that type of device? It won't work via this either.

Enough shouting.
It's a launcher of "other things" not an exciting thing in itself...

We have now included a few helper scripts to get you going called "Helper" (attached - unzip to FAT-ROOT/extensions/helper)
