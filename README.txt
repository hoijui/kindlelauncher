Supporting the DX, k2, k2i, K3 Keyboard, Kindle 4 Range, Kindle Touch's and P/W 

NOTE: Flashed 3.2.1 Dx's may not show up kindlets There is a workaround 
tested by wakawakawaka (thanks to him for the DX testing)
http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showpost.php?p=1747631&postcount=354 
Workaround 3.2.1 DX Link is above.

SUPPORT: READ THIS >>>

BitRot, No Magic, Voodoo (or Unicorns)  (what will work, what won't work)
SOME OF THE OLDER PROGRAMS NO LONGER WORK ON THE NEWER KINDLES 
(nothing to do with this launcher they just dont work properly anymore) 
SUCH AS MANY IN THIS OLD LIST: 
http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Kindle_Touch_Hacking#Extensions_for_the_GUI_Launcher 
SOME OF THESE DONT WORK, SOME WORK ON CERTAIN FIRMWARES ONLY. 
AS A COURTESY THESE APPLICATIONS ARE LISTED ON THE MAIN THREAD UNDER KNOWN ISSUES.

ALSO: SOME EXTENSION SUCH AS Kterm ARE DEVICE SPECIFIC.
THIS LAUNCHER WON'T MAGICALLY MAKE CODE THAT IS DEVICE SPECIFIC WORK ON OTHER DEVICES. 
If it doesn't normally work on that type of device? It won't work via this either.

Enough shouting. It's a launcher of "other things" not an exciting thing in itself...

We have now included a few helper scripts to get you going called "Helper" 
(attached on main thread - unzip to [FAT-ROOT]/extensions/helper)
