# IMPORTANT: You will need a file called build-local.properties,
# containing the following keys (and the correct values for your system!)
# This file is NOT checked into the repository, but is required nevertheless.

# The relevant keys, and examples of (local) values are given below. Again,
# you MUST define these keys with the values that work on YOUR system, in a
# file called build-local.properties

# JDK CLASSPATH:
# twobob's machine:
#build.classpath.jdk14=/opt/j2sdk1.4.2_19/jre/lib
# ixtab's machine:
#build.classpath.jdk14=/usr/lib/jvm/j2sdk1.4.2_19/jre/lib
