/**
 * Generic Factory class for creating UI components. Since versions 1.x and 2.x
 * of the Kindlet specification radically differ (version 2.x supports standard
 * Java Swing components, while version 1.x uses home-brew substitutes for some
 * - and by far not all - components), this is the only way to create software
 * which runs on all devices.
 * 
 * Fortunately, for this project, we don't need all that many types of UI
 * components. The idea of the methods in this class is to initialize the
 * components with everything that is required, so that standard AWT methods can
 * be used afterwards to wire everything up. IOW: implementation-specific
 * behavior should stay in this class, and its subclasses.
