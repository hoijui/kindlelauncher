CHANGE LOG
20130410,a
- Fix regression in KUAL menu sort option
# Change: now ABC sorting ignores case
+ documentation updates

20130409,a
- Fix "wrong action is executed when a menu.json file includes multiple top-level items".
- Minor fixes and improvements

20130408,a
Fix kindlet timeout issue
- Fixed the reason for kindlet timeout issue in the parse script
+ Improved script's early error reporting mechanism

20130407,a
New options and default values speed up scanning /mnt/us/extensions
# Change: by default do not recurse /mnt/us/extensions/* when
  searching for json files. Equivalent to setting KUAL_search_depth=2
# Change: by default skip searching /mnt/us/extensions/system.
+ KUAL.cfg option: KUAL_search_depth="N"
  search /mnt/us/extensions up to N levels deep (default N=2)
+ KUAL.cfg option: KUAL_search_exclude_paths="system"
  semicolon-separated list of paths to exclude when scanning
  /mnt/us/extensions.
  It does make a noticeable difference when scanning a huge extension
  folder like the 'KUAL system' extension.  Comparison: KT running
  version 20130407a vs. 20130405a w/ and w/o 'system' extension
    20130407a w/o                w/

20130405,a
Extensions can now write a message to the trail/status lines
+ Extension can write a fixed message into the trail line with json
  {"name":"label","action":"TRAIL","params":"this message","exitmenu":false}
+ Extension can write a verbatim message into the status line with json
  {"name":"label","action":"STATUS","params":"this message","exitmenu":false}
! Note that it's a fixed message; sh doesn't process it at all
+ Capture stderr of extensions to /var/tmp/KUAL.log
+ New KUAL sub-menu button "File KUAL log as a document"; moves KUAL.log to /mnt/us/documents/
! Still not quite working; the log file is always empty. Could it be due to the suicidal context ?!?
- Fix out of range index in setTrail()
- Removed more dead wood and command-line options -c -f,

20130404,d
- Fix file descriptors and segmentation fault
= Port of user option handling complete

20130404,c
- Fixed regression bug in EXTENSIONDIR scan
- Fixed missing version string (corner case)

20130404,b
+ ixtab's Unicode support for KualButton.
* commit to kindlelauncher repo

20130404,a
+ ixtab's KUAL 0.4.1 improved GUI buttons on lower devices.
Internal changes
+ Export interface #3: test_applet install
+ Scan EXTENSIONDIR and read KUAL.cfg in awk script
# Stripped more dead wood.

20130402,a
! Huge rewrite complete, I might have missed to reconnected all
  previous functions but, for the most part, KUAL 2 is here!
+ Dive-in menu support, 3 button navigation (prev, next, up) with
  trail line (press the trail line to go up).
+ Faster startup time. KT takes twobob's huge extensions folder no sweat.
+ Improved but -by design - UNFORGIVING json parser. Fix your menus.
  Invalid json files don't slow down loading the menu.
+ KUAL.log file in /mnt/us/extensions (pending bug fix).
+ KUAL menu stays fixed on top. Shows number of error messages, if any.
  Press any error message button => KUAL.log snapshot to /mnt/us/documents.
+ No suicide json key - "exitmenu":false 
+ KUAL.cfg in /mnt/us/extensions, options to: selectively hide KUAL
  menu buttons, stop following links when looking for json files, 
  hide the status line (sends status info to the trail line).
+ Show version/build number in the status line (if not hidden).
! Before starting any extension KUAL changes directory to the
  location of the menu.json file.
- Sundry bug fixes, improvements, cosmetics.
= KUAL menu: Quit, Store button, Sort 123, Sort ABC.
= Tested on KT 5.3.2 only. Should run on K3.

20130330,a
+ Start new version based on stepk's awk port of JSON.sh
! Urge to document - before I forget - the limits of nested menus:
  - maximum nesting level = 10 [0..9]
  - maximum entries per sub-menu = 255 [0..254]
    255^10 = 1,162,523,670,191,533,212,890,625 =~ =~ 1.1625 x 10^24
    1 septillion... 1 million billion billion...  Compare it with:
    4.3 x 10^17 seconds, age of the universe
    1.0 x 10^80 estimated number of atoms in the universe

20130329,b
! Archived version 20130329,b as the last version based on JSON.sh
  archive file ALOOP-JSON-SH-STABLE-20130329.zip
- Fixed null labels (again)
- Corrected documentation (LIMITS)
- Fixed npath encoder - missing first "items" byte for level 0 keys

20130329,a
! Before starting any extension the script performs a change
  directory to the location of the menu.json file
+ Show menu trail line at screen north
+ KUAL.cfg option to hide the status line at screen south
     KUAL_no_show_status="true" # requires restart
  Note: it also rerouteÑ• status messages to the trail line

20130324,a
! This is the last version compatible with KUAL1 flat menus.
- Fixed 'invalid syntax' label mangling
# Pressing any 'error message' button saves the KUAL error log as a document.
! Performance improvements. Ref. 20130318,a
  Not on the kindle but just on my PC.  Building menu with KUAL 2 vs KUAL 1
  KUAL2 has improved significantly

  # time ash aloop-v2.sh -p=tbl -v=2 >vvv2 *** KUAL2
  real 0m 2.29s
  user 0m 0.29s
  sys  0m 0.50s

  # time ash aloop-v2.sh -p=tbl -v=1 >vvv1 *** KUAL 1
  real 0m 1.79s
  user 0m 0.42s
  sys  0m 0.50s

  This is of course with invalid extensions removed, since leaving them in
  would trigger a menu recovery process in KUAL2 which would greatly slow
  down building a valid menu.

20130323,a
! Sorting is kind of broken now, but I don't care to fix it because
  eventually KUAL 2 will feature a different sorting strategy.
+ Improved error handling of invalid json files. Please note: just one
  invalid menu.json file slows down loading *all other* json files, so
  fix invalid files!
- Bug fix: connector between version 2 parser and version 1 GUI no
  longer gets stuck trying to report invalid json syntax to the kindlet
  . lists invalid files as button labels "Syntax ..filename.json"
  . tested on KT with twobob's huge extensions-K5-FAIL/ folder
+ Added 'save KUAL error log as document' function for other scripts to call.
+ KUAL.cfg option to stop following links when looking for json files:
  KUAL defaults to following links.
     KUAL_nofollow="true"    # stop following links
# changed json "exitmenu":0 to "exitmenu":false
+ added json "hidden":true to hide a menu (to be implemented)

20130319,b
+ selectively show one/more/all KUAL menu buttons
  In KUAL.cfg set
    KUAL_show_KUAL_buttons="" (or don't set at all) to show all buttons
    KUAL_show_KUAL_buttons="1 2" to show buttons 1 and 2
    KUAL_show_KUAL_buttons="0" to hide all menu buttons
    As currently defined:
     1: replace/restore Store button with KUAL
     2: change KUAL sort order (double button)
    99: quit KUAL

20130318,a
- fixed bug introduced in ver 20130306,a which could cause
  weird things to happen. Twobob, this was for you, I think!

~~~ internal step towards KUAL2 ~~~
+ new json parsing engine can parse up to 9 sub-menu levels
  . the GUI hasn't changed yet so it can't show levels above 2
  . license MIT or APACHE 2
+ option -v=1|2 selects the parsing engine; 1=old 2=new(nested,DEFAULT)
  . the new engine exposes issue http://kual.knetconnect.com/forums/topic/menu-json-structure-and-future/#post-92
    KUAL team to fix invalid menu.json files out there?
  . unlike engine 1, engine 2 doesn't touch up labels anymore
  . unlike engine 1, engine 2 doesn't make up the group label when one isn't specified
  . soon the old engine 1 will go
  . don't worry about script size, there's still a lot of dead wood
  . performance sucks for now.
Time spent processing 24 entries with engine 1 vs 2 & busybox 1.17.1 vs 1.7.2

20130306,a
user:
+ set json "exitmenu":0 (goes with "action") to save KUAL from suicide!
  If your extension prints to the screen it isn't a nice savior.
+ user-configurable page size:
  set KUAL_page_size="<integer>" in file /mnt/us/extensions/**/KUAL.cfg
internal:
+ WIP "suicide" json value
+ added usleep to screen_msg
# stripped one_level(), touch_runner()
+ send KUAL.cfg to Kindlet

--- KT/PW/K3/DX monolithic versions below and above
20130226,a,stepk
# Changed the test applet from 411.sh to printing exit message "Add extensions."
  Test applet (un)install error messages redirected to tier 1 button.
+ Added 'screen reporting area' function for other scripts to call.
  For developers, see README-dev.txt for more info
  (required changing Kindlet java code).

20130225,a,stepk
# changed/renamed command-line options as follows:
  . removed long options: --format --sort --colors --execmenu --log;
    use the short form equivalents: -f -s -c -e -l
  . removed short option -S
    -S becomes -s=123 and -s becomes -s=abc (default)
  . -f=default becomes -f=onelevel (-f=twolevel is the default)
+ added lexicographic sort option to sort by action name in addition to
  sorting by group name; applies to -f=twolevel only. Summary of sort options
  . abc  lexicographic by group, names within each group do not move
  . ABC  lexicographic by group and by action name, same name groups coalesce
  . 123  by priority, group priority first then action priority within group 
         (and lexicographic by group name within each priority tier)
+ added KUAL menu to apply all three sort options
+ added visual aid debugging option -p=FMT to output by columns, etc.
# internal changes:
  . tier placement
  . improved error handling and visualization
  . now emit each record as multiple lines
    (required changing the Kindlet's java code - read logic)
- fixed an issue with identical labels in the Kindlet's java code
- minor tweaks and fixes
+ more developer's documentation

20130221,a,stepk
+ read script options from KUAL.cfg, type aloop.sh -h for rules
  (upon config errors the script carries on with default options)
+ option -S or --nsort sorts menu by priority (json)
+ (tada!) enter the ***KUAL menu***
  with three new spanking functions:
  . Change sort order: lexicographic (abc), by priority (123)
  . 'Replace/Restore Store Button' (*)
    K5/PW only, tested on 5.3.2 should work on 5.1.2 also
  . Quit KUAL menu
+ expand entity &nbsp; (only) to hard space in json values
+ $EXTENSIONDIR can be a colon-separated list of directories
